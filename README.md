# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud detection is the collective term for the policies, tools, methodologies, and practices that credit card companies and financial institutions take to combat identity fraud and stop fraudulent transactions.  

In recent years, as the amount of data has exploded and the number of payment card transactions has skyrocketed, fraud detection has become largely digitized and automated. Most modern solutions leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to manage data analysis, predictive modeling, decision-making, fraud alerts and remediation activity that occur when individual instances of credit card fraud are detected.
